# Advancing the Clock ⏱

# As we all know too well, Time is limited—players can only play 11 scenes before their time runs out...

# After each scene, increase the D12 clock by 1 (starting at 1).

When it hits 12, all remaining players must play out their finale.

# Props 

# If the scene yields any useful items, add them to your character sheet under props.

# Plot Drivers

1. Faction shift of power  
2. New character introduced  
3. New threat emerges  
4. Event out of players’ control  
5. …  
6. Good fortune arises

**Degree of Impact**

1. Insignificant  
2. Minor  
3. Average  
4. Significant  
5. Very significant  
6. Massive

# Turn Structure

On each players turn they will do the following;

1\. Declare the action and check for a matching skill.  

2\. Decide how many Willpower tokens (if any) to spend.  

3\. Roll d6, add token bonus, and compare to the base target.  

4\. On success, narrate the result. On failure, the GM or other players seize the moment and control may shift.

# Using Flashbacks

Flashback Rolls;  Players can spend a token to declare something they “already did” in preparation for what is to come…

* First Declare what the flashback is  
* GM asks for a brief description of how it was done.  
* Roll to see how well it worked   
* If successful, narrate the payoff. If not…  disaster  
* make a scene that shifts attention  
* revisit a shared memory  
* Confess a betrayal
